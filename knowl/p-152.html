<div class="para">Another aspect of the publishing process is that of creating the physical book and making it available in bookstores, or making the the web version available on your own website.  The latter can be done automatically through GitHub pages using the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pretext deploy</code> function, but perhaps you also want to have a separate landing page that links to a version of the book you are celling on Amazon.com.  However, these steps are beyond the scope of this guide (as for suggestions on the PreTeXt-support group if you would like some assistance getting started with these steps).</div>
