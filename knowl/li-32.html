<div class="para">By design, PreTeXt imposes a rigid framework on the logical environments that can be used.  In fact, some use the name PreTeXt to refer to this framework itself (as distinguished from its current implementation).</div>
<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">This framework is intended to balance two conflicting goals:</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">Allow the author to focus on content as opposed to presentation</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Facilitate the OER principles of Adapting and Remixing existing works.</div></li>
</ol>
<div class="para">These principles are in tension because many authors will instinctively use different categories and logical divisions as they author their books. However, when authors are given free rein to develop their own logical divisions, it becomes very difficult to "remix" (combine sections of) books written by different authors.</div>
</div>
<div class="para">It is therefore necessary to draw the line somewhere.  Over many years of careful work, the authors of PreTeXt have come up with one way of drawing this line, that can be made to work for a wide range of mathematical texts.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-15.html#li-32" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
