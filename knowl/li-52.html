<div class="para">In theory, the PreTeXt language can compile into a variety of different web formats, each with a different philosophy of how to present information to the user. This is another reason why it is important to carefully follow the syntax as intended, rather than hacking together different elemnts based on their behavior.</div>
<div class="para">At the same time, it will be valuable for an author to understand the core design principles of the <em class="emphasis">current</em> web format.</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Collapsed Details Emphasizes Overall Structure</em>. By default, many (even most) environments are collapsed (knowled) when a user first visits the section. This helps emphasize the overall structure of the material, and can almost act as an automatic summary of the section. As a student goes through the material, they expand the relevant element they are working on, deepening their knowledge of the material.</div></li>
<li>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">References Show a Web of Knowledge</em>. Make regular use of the built in environments such as <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">definition</code>, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">theorem</code>, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">example</code>, and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">figure</code>, and make sure you use unique identifiers with the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">@xml:id</code>  attribute.</div>
<div class="para">Whenever you reference this attribute PreTeXt creates a link which, when you click on it, expands and displays the previous content (e.g. definition) in the current context. Students can also click on the "show in context" link to go back to the section where this was originally introduced.</div>
<div class="para">This helps emphasize how the web of mathematical knowledge develops across larger divisions such as sections, chapters, and parts.</div>
