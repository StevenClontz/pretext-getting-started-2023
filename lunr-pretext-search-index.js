  "body": "  Note  This JMM Professional Enhancement Program will be held on Thursday, January 5 between 9 am - 11 am and Saturday, January 7 between 9 am - 11 am in Salon CD on the fourth floor of the Boston Marriott Copley Place.    PreTeXt is a document authoring system that allows you to convert the source of your document into a variety of output formats, including fully accessible webpages, PDF, Epub, Jupyter Notebooks, and braille. This “write once, read anywhere” approach has made it a popular choice for authors of Open Educational Resources, but PreTeXt can also be used to create other kinds of mathematical documents as well. Recent updates make this process much easier; there has never been a better time to get started with PreTeXt.  Participants of this PEP will be introduced to the fundamentals of authoring documents with PreTeXt and gain the technical skills required to work with it. Specifically, participants will learn how to:    Use GitHub Codespaces to create an editable PreTeXt document in their web browser.  Write and structure content using PreTeXt markup.  Add content to the document, including mathematics, graphics, interactive exercises, and more.  Build accessible and interactive webpages as well as a static PDF from the same PreTeXt source.  Easily deploy the interactive webpages online (for free).    We will also share tips for converting existing documents into PreTeXt.  Prior to the PEP, participants should have some familiarity with LaTeX or other markup languages. No previous experience working with PreTeXt or HTML\/XML is assumed. Participants should bring a laptop that can connect to JMM's provided wifi: no prior installations will be required as we will use PreTeXt's new GitHub Codespace-powered online authoring service.  "

There are two ways to approach this problem. First, you can manually select the random seed to ensure that all quadratics have real roots.

Remember that the < and > symbols are restricted. For lines, it is eaisest to use latex or stealth as your arrow style. If you must use < and > in your TikZ code, you must replace the symbols with &lt; and &gt; respectively.    <sidebyside widths=\"33% 33%\" margins=\"11%\" valign=\"middle\"> <image width=\"25%\" xml:id=\"tikz_quick_eg\"> <latex-image> \\begin{tikzpicture} \\draw[fill=red,opacity=0.2] (0,0) circle (1.15); \\draw[fill=blue,opacity=0.2] (1,0) circle (1.15); \\end{tikzpicture} <\/latex-image> <\/image> <image width=\"33%\" xml:id=\"image_tikz_eg\"> <latex-image> \\begin{tikzpicture} \\\\ Shade the enclosed area first \\draw[color=white,fill=green,opacity=0.33] (1,0) -- (1,{cos(1 r)+2}) -- plot[domain= 1:3] ({\\x},{cos(\\x r)+2}) -- (3,{cos(3 r)+2}) -- (3,0) -- (1,0); \\\\ Draw the axes \\draw[latex-latex] (-1,0) -- (5,0); \\draw[latex-latex] (0,-1) -- (0,4); \\\\ Plot the function \\draw [thick,domain=-1:4.5] plot ({\\x},{cos(\\x r)+2}); \\node [thick,above right] at (4.5,{cos(4.5 r) + 2}){$f$}; \\\\ Draw the boundaries \\draw[red] (1,3) -- (1,-0.25) node [below] {$a$}; \\draw[red] (3,3) -- (3,-0.25) node [below] {$b$}; \\\\ Label the area \\draw[&lt;- , very thick] (2,0.5) -- (2.2,-1) node[below] {area between $f$ and $x$-axis over $[a,b]$}; \\end{tikzpicture} <\/latex-image> <\/image> <\/sidebyside>      Create the following interactive JSXGraph graphic     See for the pretext reference.  It is important to note that JessieCode has a different syntax than classic JSXGraph, but has the benefit of being able to write the code directly in the PreTeXt file.  You can see several examples of JessieCode syntax by going to and scrolling down to \"Element functions\", and by reading .  Generally, a line of JessieCode can be found by finding the relevant JSXGraph object and attributes, and rewriting this as a function of the same name followed by properties in <<...>>. For example, b1.create('point',[1,2], {name:'X', size:4}); becomes point(1,2) << name:'X', size:4 >> ; . In PreTeXt, < and > is replaced by &lt; and &gt; , and the code gets a bit messy.  Many, but not all, features of JSXGraph are available in JessieCode. You can find a collection of examples written using classic JSXGraph, and the full JSXGraph Documentation . With a bit of experimentation, it is often possible to translate most JSXGraph code into JessieCode.    <interactive platform=\"jsxgraph\" width=\"50%\"> <slate xml:id=\"jsxgraph-slope-via-tangent\" surface=\"jessiecode\" axis=\"true\" grid=\"true\" > \/\/ Set the graph window. \/\/ The order of values is [xmin, ymax, xmax, ymin] \/\/ keepaspectratio=true forces the x and y scales to be equal $board.setBoundingBox( [ -5, 10, 7, -6 ] , keepaspectratio=false) ; \/\/ Create the slider xslider = slider( \/\/ Specify slider location [0.5,-3], [5.5,-3], \/\/ Specify smallest\/starting\/largest value for slider [-5,1,7]) &lt;&lt; name:\"a\", snapWidth:0.01 &gt;&gt; ; \/\/ Define a function and its tangent line at the current slider value \/\/ This will allow us to reference them in several places f1 = function(x) { return 1\/5*(x+3)*(x-2)*(x-5)-1; } ; tangentline = function(x) { x0 = xslider.Value(); m = (f1(x0+0.00001) - f1(x0))\/0.00001; return m*(x-x0) + f1(x0) ; } ; \/\/ Graph the function and its tangent line f1Graph = functiongraph( f1 ) &lt;&lt; strokeColor:\"blue\" &gt;&gt;; tangentGraph = functiongraph( tangentline ) &lt;&lt; strokeColor:\"black\", dash:3 &gt;&gt;; \/\/ Display the equation of the current tangent line text( 1.5,5.5,function() { x0 = xslider.Value(); m = (f1(x0+0.00001) - f1(x0))\/0.00001; y0 = f1(x0); return \"y = \"+ trunc(m,2) + \" ( x- \" + trunc(x0,2) + \" ) + \" + trunc(y0,2) ; } ) &lt;&lt; color:\"black\", fontSize:16 &gt;&gt; ; \/\/ Graph the lines from the point to the x and y axis line( [function() {return xslider.Value();} , function() {return f1(xslider.Value());}],[0,function() {return f1(xslider.Value());}] ) &lt;&lt; color:\"red\", straightFirst:false, straightLast:false, dash:1 &gt;&gt; ; line( [function() {return xslider.Value();} , function() {return f1(xslider.Value());}],[function() {return xslider.Value();}, 0 ] ) &lt;&lt; color:\"red\", straightFirst:false, straightLast:false, dash:1 &gt;&gt; ; \/\/ Draw a dot at the current point on the function point( function() {return xslider.Value();} , function() {return f1(xslider.Value());}) &lt;&lt; name:\"(a,f(a))\", color:\"red\" &gt;&gt; ; \/\/ Label the x and y values of the current point text( -0.75, function() {return f1(xslider.Value());}, \"f(a)\") &lt;&lt; color:\"red\" &gt;&gt; ; text( function() {return xslider.Value();} , -0.25 , \"a\") &lt;&lt; color:\"red\" &gt;&gt; ; <\/slate> <\/interactive>      Create the following table using the pretext tabular environment.     1  2  3    4  5  6     <tabular> <col right=\"medium\" \/><col right=\"medium\" \/><col \/> <row bottom=\"medium\"> <cell>1<\/cell> <cell>2<\/cell> <cell>3<\/cell> <\/row> <row> <cell>4<\/cell> <cell>5<\/cell> <cell>6<\/cell> <\/row> <\/tabular>    Create the same table using a latex array environment.    <me> \\begin{array}{c|c|c} 1 \\amp 2 \\amp 3 \\\\ \\hline 4 \\amp 5 \\amp 6 \\end{array} <\/me>    "

It is important to note that JessieCode has a different syntax than classic JSXGraph, but has the benefit of being able to write the code directly in the PreTeXt file.  You can see several examples of JessieCode syntax by going to and scrolling down to \"Element functions\", and by reading .  Generally, a line of JessieCode can be found by finding the relevant JSXGraph object and attributes, and rewriting this as a function of the same name followed by properties in <<...>>. For example, b1.create('point',[1,2], {name:'X', size:4}); becomes point(1,2) << name:'X', size:4 >> ; . In PreTeXt, < and > is replaced by &lt; and &gt; , and the code gets a bit messy.  Many, but not all, features of JSXGraph are available in JessieCode. You can find a collection of examples written using classic JSXGraph, and the full JSXGraph Documentation .

For example, the example , exercise , project , and task environments are essentially the only environments that can contain solution , hint , and answer sub-environments. However , these sub-environments are only allowed in a very specific format. If solutions are to be used, they must be paired with a statement (and optionally hint, answer) and no other divisions , not even a paragraph.    Never Write  <example> <p> A paragraph, ending in a question. <\/p> <solution> <p> A solution to the question in the paragraph. <\/p> <\/solution> <\/example>    Always Write  <example> <statement> <p> A paragraph, ending in a question. <\/p> <\/statement> <solution> <p> A solution to the question in the paragraph. <\/p> <\/solution> <\/example>      References  To reference content on the web, write <url href=\"\">Display Text\/<\/url> , or write <url href=\"\" \/> if you would like the full URL displayed, or  If you would like to reference text inside the PreTeXt document, place that text inside an environment, and include the attribute xml:id=\"REFNAME\" in its opening tag. To reference the element elsewhere in the document, type <xref ref=\"REFNAME\"\/>     Emphasizing Text   em  emphasizes , while alert  shoults .  To add a title without creating a new (sub*)section, use the paragraphs environment.  <paragraphs> <title>Title<\/title> <p> Paragraph text. <\/p> <\/paragraphs>    Summarizing Concepts  Use the assemblage environment to summarize content, such as a list of formulas. Assemblages are not numbered, so when you reference them you need to add text='custom' or text='title' . For example, you would need to type to any < xref text='title' ref=\"REFNAME\" \/>     Restrictions on Environments  By design, PreTeXt imposes a rigid framework on the logical environments that can be used. In fact, some use the name PreTeXt to refer to this framework itself (as distinguished from its current implementation).  This framework is intended to balance two conflicting goals:   Allow the author to focus on content as opposed to presentation    Facilitate the OER principles of Adapting and Remixing existing works.   These principles are in tension because many authors will instinctively use different categories and logical divisions as they author their books. However, when authors are given free rein to develop their own logical divisions, it becomes very difficult to \"remix\" (combine sections of) books written by different authors.  It is therefore necessary to draw the line somewhere. Over many years of careful work, the authors of PreTeXt have come up with one way of drawing this line, that can be made to work for a wide range of mathematical texts.    Principles for the (Current) Web Interfae  In theory, the PreTeXt language can compile into a variety of different web formats, each with a different philosophy of how to present information to the user. This is another reason why it is important to carefully follow the syntax as intended, rather than hacking together different elemnts based on their behavior.  At the same time, it will be valuable for an author to understand the core design principles of the current web format.     Collapsed Details Emphasizes Overall Structure . By default, many (even most) environments are collapsed (knowled) when a user first visits the section. This helps emphasize the overall structure of the material, and can almost act as an automatic summary of the section. As a student goes through the material, they expand the relevant element they are working on, deepening their knowledge of the material.     References Show a Web of Knowledge . Make regular use of the built in environments such as definition , theorem , example , and figure , and make sure you use unique identifiers with the @xml:id attribute.  Whenever you reference this attribute PreTeXt creates a link which, when you click on it, expands and displays the previous content (e.g. definition) in the current context. Students can also click on the \"show in context\" link to go back to the section where this was originally introduced.  This helps emphasize how the web of mathematical knowledge develops across larger divisions such as sections, chapters, and parts.      Mastering PreTeXt Syntax  When you use a more complex environment for the first time or in a new way, double check the PreTeXt schema .  The Content of the XML Representation Summary tells you what type of content the environment is allowed to contain. Be careful when reading the Schema, and refer to the abbreviations in the documentation .  For example, consider the entry for the exercise environment. Even though the exercise environment permits p and solution environments, they cannot be used at the same time, as they are in separate Groupings ( ) that are combined by a Choice |. If you want to use a solution in an exercise , the exercise must consist of a statement followed by zero or more hint , answer , or solution environments.  You can also use the Schema to see where an environment can be used, by looking at the Included in content model of elements section of the page. This will help you make sure that you are placing your environment in a valid location. For example the exercise environment can be used in (among other places) sections and subsections, but not inside of another exercise.    Uniquely Flexible Environments   task environments can be placed in example , exercise , and project-like environments. Task environments can contain text and images, but they can also contain solution environments, and can even contain nested task environments.   Note: PreTeXt does not have a general use \"details\" environment. The fn (footnote) environment is officially restricted to text only, even though it currently compiles correctly with content including images, display math, etc.  The task environment provides an alternative (and officially approved) approach to incorporating knowled text throughout examples and project-like environments: simply write the main content in the statement for the main content, the knowled content in the solution , and add an instruction to the reader to come up with the hidden content on their own.  Nested lists are available, since li elements can contain new list environments.     "
