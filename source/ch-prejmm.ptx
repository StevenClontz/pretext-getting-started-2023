            Authoring in PreTeXt requires nothing more
            than a wifi connection and GitHub account.
            GitHub users also can share their
            content for free on GitHub Pages!

                (The program description references CoCalc.com,
                another service that can be used to author PreTeXt,
                but workshop plans have been updated to focus primarily on
                GitHub workflows.)

            Wifi will be available in our room at the JMM, so
            each participant will only need to bring their laptop.
            No installation of software is required

        <title>Setting up your GitHub account</title>
        <p>
            To create a GitHub account, 
            <url href="https://github.com/signup">
                follow the instructions on GitHub's
                signup page.
            </url>
        </p>
        <p>
            Be sure to note your GitHub username and password in your password manager
            (or however you usually keep track of login credentials) so you can log in
            again at the Joint Mathematics Meetings.

        <title>Apply for your GitHub Education discount</title>
        <p>
            Educators and non-profit researchers can get many of GitHub's paid features
            for free.
        </p>
        <p>
            Apply at
            <url href="https://education.github.com/discount_requests/pack_application">Education.GitHub.com</url>
            to unlock these features (in our experience, applications are usually processed quickly for <c>.edu</c>
            email addresses).

        <title>And that's it!</title>
        <p>
            Even just a couple months ago, the process to get started writing PreTeXt
            involved several more steps. (Raise your hand if you don't care what a
            <q>PATH variable</q> is!)
        </p>
        <p>
            The community is streamlining this experience
            daily, and we look forward to sharing how easy writing in PreTeXt is when we meet 
            you at the JMM!
