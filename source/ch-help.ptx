  <title>Getting Help</title>

  <p>
    Here we collect a number of useful resources to help you when you are stuck.  The official <url
      href="https://pretextbook.org/">PreTeXt site</url> has lots of resources, but we understand it can be overwhelming.
  </p>

    <title>Official documentation</title>
    
    <p>
      Note that the official <url href="https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/guide-toc.html">PreTeXt Guide</url> can be hard to use because there is so much stuff in it.  Additionally, some of the documentation is out of date.  Still, if you know where to look, it is a great resource.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here are some sections that we find especially helpful:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <url href="https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/part-basics.html">Basics Reference</url>: A listing of the main elements of <pretext /> including snippets of the code that create them.  This is one of the few places in the guide that has examples of the markup.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <url href="https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/publication-file-reference.html">Publication File Reference</url>: When you are ready to start changing how your output looks, you can use the <term>publication file</term>, which is described in this part of the guide. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <url href="https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/schema.html">PreTeXt Schema</url>: The official list of elements and where they can go is given in the PreTeXt Schema, which is described here.  Also you can check out the <url href="https://pretextbook.org/doc/schema/">schema browser</url> to actually view the schema.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <url href="https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/quickstart-getting-pretext.html">Getting PreTeXt</url>: If you want to install <pretext /> on your own computer, this early part of the guide gives you directions.  It should be updated with information on CodeSpaces soon as well, if you need a refresher.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      Finally, note that the search in <pretext /> now works really well, and searching for a feature will usually get you pointed in the right spot.

    <title>Examples</title>

    <p>
      The <url href="https://pretextbook.org/examples.html">Examples</url> page on the <pretext /> site contains a number of useful live examples.  Links are provided to web, pdf, and source (on GitHub).  For some of the examples, there is also an <em>annotated</em> version available.  We find these especially helpful since you can <q>view source</q> to see exactly how each bit of the example was marked up in code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are some of the most useful such examples:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <url
              href="https://pretextbook.org/examples/sample-book/annotated/">Sample Book</url>: This annotated sample book contains a section on <url
              href="https://pretextbook.org/examples/sample-book/annotated/interactive-exercises.html">interactive exercises</url>.  The PreTeXt developers use this book for testing, so you can see the latest (sometimes experimental) features available.
          </p>
        </li>
       <li>
          <p>
            <url href="https://pretextbook.org/examples/sample-article/annotated">Sample Article</url>: Not particularly well organized (it is also a proving ground for developers) but this contains almost every variation of every feature of <pretext />.  Using the search and <q>view source</q> makes this an invaluable resource.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

    <title>Community Support</title>
    <p>
      There is a very active google group for support: <url
        href="https://groups.google.com/g/pretext-support">pretext-support</url>.  You should also subscribe to the low-traffic <url
        href="https://groups.google.com/g/pretext-announce">pretext-announce</url> to get updates.
