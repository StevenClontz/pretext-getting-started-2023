    <p>
      <url href="https://pretextbook.org">PreTeXt</url> is a document authoring system that allows
      you to convert the source of your document into a variety of output formats, including fully
      accessible webpages, PDF, Epub, Jupyter Notebooks, and braille. This “write once, read
      anywhere” approach has made it a popular choice for authors of Open Educational Resources, but
      PreTeXt can also be used to create other kinds of mathematical documents as well. Recent
      updates make this process much easier; there has never been a better time to get started with
      PreTeXt. </p>
    <p>
      Participants of this workshop will be introduced to the fundamentals of authoring documents
      with PreTeXt and gain the technical skills required to work with it. Specifically,
      participants will learn how to:
    </p>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use GitHub Codespaces to create an editable PreTeXt document in their web browser.</li>
      <li>Write and structure content using PreTeXt markup.</li>
      <li>Add content to the document, including mathematics, graphics, interactive exercises, and
        more.</li>
      <li>Build accessible and interactive webpages as well as a static PDF from the same PreTeXt
        source.</li>
      <li>Easily deploy the interactive webpages online (for free).</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      We will also share tips for converting existing documents into PreTeXt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to the workshop, participants should have some familiarity with LaTeX or other markup
      languages.
      No previous experience working with PreTeXt or HTML/XML is assumed.
      Participants should bring a laptop that can connect to JMM's provided wifi: no prior
      installations will be required
      as we will use PreTeXt's new GitHub Codespace-powered online authoring service.
