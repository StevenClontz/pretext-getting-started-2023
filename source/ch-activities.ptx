<description>Two functions are graphed here: f(x) and f'(x). The function f(x) is the same as the above graph, that is, roughly sinusoidal, starting at (-4, 3), decreasing to a local minimum at (-2, 2), then increasing to a local maximum at (3, 6), and getting cut off at (7, 2). The function f'(x) is an downward-facing parabola with vertex near (0.5, 1.75), y-intercept (0, 1.5), and x-intercepts (-1.9, 0) and (3, 0).</description>
<description>The function f(x) = x squared - 2x is graphed as is its derivative f'(x) = 2x - 2.</description>
