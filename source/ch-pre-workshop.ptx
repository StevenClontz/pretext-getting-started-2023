        <p>
            Authoring in PreTeXt requires nothing more
            than a wifi connection and GitHub account.
            GitHub users also can share their
            content for free on GitHub Pages!

            Educators and non-profit researchers can get many of GitHub's paid features
            for free.

        <title>And that's it!</title>
        <p>
            Even just a last year, the process to get started writing PreTeXt
            involved several more steps. (Raise your hand if you don't care what a
            <q>PATH variable</q> is!)
        </p>
        <p>
            The community is streamlining this experience
            daily, and we look forward to sharing how easy writing in PreTeXt is when we see you at the workshop
