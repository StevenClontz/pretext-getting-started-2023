        <title>Setting up Codespaces</title>
        <p> A <term>Codespace</term> is an authoring environment that lives in the <q>cloud</q>,
            that is, a virtual machine hosted by GitHub that has all of the software needed to
            create great accessible documents, accessible with just a web browser. </p>
        <p>
            This coding environment uses a web version of Virtual Studio
            Code, an open-source editor, along with the PreTeXt community's
            custom plugins and software to get started authoring quickly.
        </p>
        <p> Follow the instructions at <url href="https://github.com/PreTeXtBook/pretext-codespace" />
            to get started. Let this run for a few minutes in the background while you review the
            rest of this section. </p>

        <title>Not Just HTML, Not Just PDF</title>
        <p> This document is available in HTML format at <url
                href="https://stevenclontz.github.io/ptx-jmm-2023/" />, and the same document is
            available in a PDF format at <url
                href="https://stevenclontz.github.io/ptx-jmm-2023/pdf/main.pdf" />. </p>
        <p> Obtaining these formats are as easy as running <c>pretext build web</c> and
            <c>pretext build print</c> respectively. PreTeXt supports other types of output as well, including
            Jupyter notebooks, ePub, and tacticle braille code.</p>
        <p> You're encouraged to view authoring in
            PreTeXt as an <em>investment</em>: you may not need the braille output today, but the little
            extra thought and care required to author in PreTeXt will allow you to provide this
            version of your document to a blind student tomorrow. </p>

            Go check back on your Codespace. If it's up and running, you're ready to
            move on to the next section!
