        <title>File and directory structure</title>
        <p>
            Here we describe the file and directory structure of a project.  PreTeXt allows a fair amount of flexibility in how you structure the project, but we believe the following are best practices.
            <dl>
                <li>
                    <title><c>source</c> folder</title>
                    <p>
                        Contains all your <c>.ptx</c> files that hold the content of your document.  A new book starts with just a single file, but later we will see how to modularize the source to make organizing it easier.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <title><c>publication</c> folder</title>
                    <p>
                        Contains your <c>publication.ptx</c> file or files, which define the publication-specific information about your document, as we saw in <xref ref="ch-publication"/>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <title><c>assets</c> folder</title>
                    <p>
                        Put any images or other static files that you will include in your document here. This does not include images that you describe inside your source (like <tag>latex-image</tag>).  You can have subfolders as you like, and if you refer to these files in your source, you do <alert>not</alert> use <q>assets</q> as part of the file name (<pretext /> knows where to look, since this is specified in the <c>publication.ptx</c> file.)
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <title><c>generated-assets</c> folder</title>
                    <p>
                        This is a folder that <pretext /> automatically creates and fills with assets that it generates from your source.  You shouldn't edit anything in this folder.  It is not tracked by git by default.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <title><c>output</c> folder</title>
                    <p>
                        Another folder created by <pretext />.  It will contain the results of <c>pretext build</c>.  In general, you should not touch anything in this folder. Not tracked by git by default.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <title><c>project.ptx</c> file</title>
                    <p>
                        This is the <term>project manifest</term> file, which you use to manage the different builds of your project.  We will describe how to use this in more detail below.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </dl>
        </p>
        <p>
            There are a few other files that you might see in a project, such as <c>requirements.txt</c> and <c>.gitignore</c>.  Don't worry about these for now.
        </p>
        <p>
            When your project grows, you will likely want to separate your <c>main.ptx</c> source file (inside the <c>source</c> folder) into multiple <c>.ptx</c> files.  For example, you might want a single file per chapter, and even a separate file for each section.  You can do this by using the <tag>xi:include</tag> tag.  For example, if you have a file <c>source/chapter1.ptx</c> that contains the first chapter of your book, you can include it in your <c>main.ptx</c> file like this: 
            <cd>
                <cline>&lt;xi:include href="./chapter1.ptx" /&gt;</cline>
            </cd>
            In the top level tag of the file in which you use <tag>xi:include</tag> (in this case, <c>main.ptx</c>), you must add the following attribute: 
            <cd>
                <cline>xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"</cline>
            </cd>
        </p>    
        <p>
            Then in the <c>chapter1.ptx</c> file, you would start with the standard <tag>?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?</tag> followed by the top-level tag <tag>chapter</tag>.  There can only be one top level tag in this file.  A second chapter would need to be its own file and <tag>xi:include</tag> it separately.
        </p>

            You will likely want to build your source file into multiple output formats.  How do you tell <pretext /> what outputs you want?  You keep track of this, and some other information, in your <c>project.ptx</c> file.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <c>project.ptx</c> file is a <term>project manifest</term> file.  It is used to manage the different builds of your project.  It is a <c>.ptx</c> file, but it is not part of the content of your document.  It is used to tell <pretext /> how to build your document.
        </p>
        <p>
            For now, take a look at the <c>project.ptx</c> file in this project.  You will see that there are multiple <term>targets</term> each with a <term>name</term>, and a specified <tag>format</tag>, <tag>source</tag>, <tag>publication</tag> (file), and <tag>output-dir</tag> (directory).  The <tag>source</tag> and <tag>publication</tag> are probably the same for all targets, but they don't have to be.
