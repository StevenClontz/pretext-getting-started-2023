      Let's get our hands dirty and try writing some PreTeXt.  If you have some ideas of what you want to try, go for it.  Otherwise, try to implement as many of the following as you can.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Write a numbered list of your favorite three animals and an unnumbered list of your three favorite numbers (in no particular order).  Put text introducing the lists between them.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        You can use the <tag>ol</tag> tag for ordered lists, and <tag>ul</tag> for unordered lists.  Each item should be inside <tag>li</tag>s.  
      </p>
    </hint>
    <hint>
      <p>
        For the content around the lists, you will want them to be in <tag>p</tag> tags.  Note also that the list themselves must be nested in these paragraphs.  You can't have lists floating on their own.
      </p>

  Here is my list of animals:
  <ol>
    <li>Shark</li>
    <li>Sloth</li>
    <li>Slork</li>
  </ol>
</p>

  My favorite numbers, in no particular order, happen to be:
  <ul>
    <li>1</li>
    <li>2</li>
    <li>3</li>
  </ul>
