# Outline and To Do list for PEP

## Things to do

Obviously we need to plan content and create an outline (see below).  Other things include:

[] Write this tutorial/guide for participants
[] Improve pretext-tools (with code-chat)
[] Get github codespaces working
  [] Templates?
[] Check that pandoc-pretext is still working
[] Decide what sorts of interactive elements we want to explore.
  - Parson's problems
  - Multiple choice
  - WeBWorK (server or locally authored)
  - Embedded youtube
[] Do we want to suggest using PreTeXt for course materials?  Worksheets?
[] Contact participants to get them ready for the PEP
  - Ask participants what they hope to get out of the workshop.  Are there any particular projects they hope to complete with PreTeXt?  Do they have materials they want to convert?
  - Ask each participant to make a github account (with instructions).
  - How familiar is each participant with the command line?  Should we do everything with the VSCode gui?
  - Is everyone familiar with LaTeX?
  - Are there output formats anyone is particularly interested in?
  - Instructions for downloading pretext if they want to do things on their local machine.

## Outline

Each day is 2 hours (9-11am Thursday and Saturday).  

### Thursday

- Introductions.
- Brief overview of how PreTeXt works (what the parts are). 
- Jump in: everyone makes a repository on github, creates a new book, builds, views, and deploys.
- Discussion of PreTeXt philosophy, i.e., author vs publisher, semantic markup, consequences for accessibility
- Exploration of document structure.  Boxes in Boxes next to Boxes.
- Exercise: how would you describe the semantic structure of a particular section of a particular document?  Maybe provide a latex document and have everyone "convert" it to pretext by hand.

### Saturday

- Review and take stock.  Answer questions
- How to use the documentation (annotated version).
- What if you get stuck?
- Adding interactive content.
- Worksheets?
- Runestone? (Note that we are not ready to let just anyone upload just anything to runestone.academy, so this might be a distraction)
- Other output types
- Publisher options
